  title={When Investors Don’t Trust the NAV: Valuation Opacity, Runs, and ‘Retailization’ of Private Equity},
  author={Awuni, Mathias},
  year={2026},
  journal={Working Paper},
  pdf={Mawuni_UNC_Paper.pdf},
  selected={true},
  note={<strong>Presentations:</strong> UNC Alternative Investments Conference 2026 (Scheduled)},
  abstract={I explore how valuation opacity in private equity funds can lead to run-like behavior among retail investors. As private equity "retailizes," I argue that the lack of transparent, market-based NAVs creates a first-mover advantage for redemptions during liquidity crunches.}

  note={<strong>Presentations:</strong> Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference (BCERC) 2026},
  abstract={I study the causal effect of worker misclassification laws (e.g., AB5) on entrepreneurial entry. Using state-level variations in legal definitions of "employee," I show that stricter classification reduces gig-economy entry but increases the quality of incorporated startups.}

  title={Regulatory Complexity and Corporate Venture Capital},

  journal={Working Paper},
  selected={true},
  abstract={I investigate how increasing regulatory complexity impacts the investment strategies of Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) firms. Using a dataset of CVC deals from 2010-2024, I find that higher regulatory burdens lead CVCs to shift away from early-stage startups toward later-stage, lower-risk investments.}

  journal={Working Paper},
  selected={true},
  abstract={This paper analyzes the long-term survival rates of startups that experience "hyper-growth" in their early stages. I document a "speed penalty" where firms that scale premature to product-market fit face a 20% higher likelihood of failure in subsequent rounds.}

  abstract={I exploit the exogenous shock of local mass shootings to study risk aversion in angel investing. I find that angel investment activity in affected counties drops significantly in the quarter following an event, suggesting that local violence increases perceived tail risk for early-stage investors.}

  note={<strong>Presentations:</strong> Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference (BCERC) 2026},
  abstract={This paper models the trade-offs founders face when choosing between VC funding and bootstrapping. I demonstrate that while VCs provide essential scaling capital, the loss of control and misalignment of exit horizons can be suboptimal for founders in niche markets.}

  abstract={I analyze how Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) influences Venture Capital exit strategies. Finding that high EPU periods are associated with a significant decrease in IPOs and a corresponding increase in M&A exits, I suggest VCs prioritize liquidity speed over valuation maximization during uncertain times.}
