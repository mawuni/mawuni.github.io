  title={Regulatory Complexity and Corporate Venture Capital},
  author={Awuni, Mathias},
  year={2026},
  journal={Working Paper},
  selected={true},
  abstract={I examine how regulatory fragmentation affects corporate venture capital (CVC) investment. Using firm-level measures of regulatory fragmentation for active CVC investors, I document a robust non-monotonic relationship: moderate fragmentation reduces investment frequency by 25.6% relative to low fragmentation, while effects attenuate at extreme levels. This deterrence operates independently of regulatory intensity, volume, and topic breadth, isolating coordination complexity as the primary friction. The mechanism is a fixed coordination cost: fragmentation reduces deal count but increases average deal size, indicating a “flight to quality” where firms abandon marginal investments. High-R&D firms uniquely mitigate these costs through absorptive capacity; this adaptation is driven by organizational capabilities rather than financial slack, as cash-rich but low-innovation firms fail to adapt. These patterns emerged post-2010, following the Dodd-Frank expansion of regulatory oversight.}

  author={Awuni, Mathias},
  year={2026},
  journal={Working Paper},
  selected={false},
  note={<strong>Presentations:</strong> Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference (BCERC) 2026},
  abstract={Venture capital is widely viewed as a uniform accelerant for startups. We argue that VCs function instead as extreme polarization agents, transforming entrepreneurship from a steady business game into a “lottery ticket” game. Using a sample of U.S. startups, we document a “Hollow Middle”where VC backing provides zero marginal benefit to the bottom 75% of ventures (p > 0.30) while driving a 2-fold valuation surge at the 90th percentile (β90 = 0.71). We identify the causal mechanism as a Governance Shock. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences framework robust to staggered timing, we find that VCs do not merely select high-variance firms but actively engineer volatility. Immediately upon investment (t = 0), the probability of founder departure spikes by 1.3 percentage points (z = 7.53) and accelerates to 5.4 percentage points by year 2 (z = 19.94). This active destabilization forces a binary “up-or-out” trajectory, structurally eliminating moderate outcomes to maximize tail-end returns.}

  note={<strong>Presentations:</strong> Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference (BCERC) 2026},
  abstract={We examine how worker classification laws reshape entrepreneurial ecosystems by compelling firms to reclassify independent contractors as employees. Exploiting California's Assembly Bill 5 as a quasi-experiment, we document that high-propensity business applications declined 10.8 percentage points in contractor-intensive sectors. Effects persist and intensify through 2024, revealing regulatory costs operating through deterred venture formation, capital reallocation, reduced employment growth, and organizational restructuring. The evidence shows that classification laws generate substantial spillovers beyond targeted industries, fundamentally altering the cost structure and viability of contractor-dependent business models with lasting implications for entrepreneurial dynamism and innovation capacity.}
