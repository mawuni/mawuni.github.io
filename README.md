Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in **Entrepreneurial Finance** at Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ.  
My research explores how external shocksâ€”such as policy changes, platform dynamics, and legal reclassificationsâ€”affect entrepreneurship, venture finance, and investor behavior.

---

My current work investigates how **economic policy uncertainty** and legal frictions shape investor decisions, startup formation, and entrepreneurial resilience.
