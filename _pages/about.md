Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at Stevens Institute of Technology. My research studies how **financing, regulation, and market structure shape entrepreneurial outcomes**, with a particular focus on **venture capital, firm dynamics, and the distribution of startup growth and failure**.

I am especially interested in settings where policy or institutional changes alter incentives for founders, investors, and workers, and in understanding how these changes affect **entry, exit, growth trajectories, and risk-taking** among young firms. Much of my work uses large-scale U.S. administrative data combined with quasi-experimental and structural methods.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc in Finance (FinTech and Financial Analytics) from Hong Kong Baptist University and an MBA in Finance from the University of Mysore. I also have industry experience as a Co-Founder of **Coucou Connect** and as a Business Analyst at **Crypto.com** in Hong Kong.

I am currently working on my dissertation under the advisement of **Prof. Stefano Bonini**.
