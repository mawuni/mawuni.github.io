Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in **Entrepreneurial Finance** at Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ.  
My research explores how external shocksâ€”such as policy changes, platform dynamics, and legal reclassificationsâ€”affect entrepreneurship, venture finance, and investor behavior.

My current work investigates how **economic policy uncertainty** and legal frictions shape investor decisions, startup formation, and entrepreneurial resilience. I focus on innovative financing channels (like micro-influencers), emerging exit mechanisms (such as secondary sales), and empirical identification using panel regressions, event studies, and Bartik IVs.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I worked on FinTech ventures and corporate finance projects in Ghana and Hong Kong. I co-founded *Coucou Connect*, an alternative credit scoring company, where we use novel data for credit access decisions.

_Outside research_, I enjoy mentoring startup founders, experimenting with macroeconomic forecasting models, and curating African entrepreneurial data.
