## Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at Stevens Institute of Technology.

My research examines how financing, regulation, and market structure shape entrepreneurial outcomes. I focus on three broad areas:

Venture Capital and Startup Dynamics. I study how venture capital financing affects the distribution of startup outcomes, including growth trajectories, exit paths, and failure rates.

Regulation and Entrepreneurship. I investigate how policy and institutional changes, such as worker classification laws and regulatory complexity, alter incentives for founders, investors, and workers, with consequences for firm entry, exit, and risk-taking.

Private Markets and Investor Behavior. I explore how information frictions and valuation opacity in private markets influence investor decisions and capital flows.
