My research examines how financing, regulation, and market structure shape entrepreneurial outcomes. I employ causal inference techniques and machine learning to explore three broad areas:

**1. Venture Capital and Startup Dynamics** I study how venture capital financing affects the distribution of startup outcomes, including growth trajectories, exit paths, and failure rates. My JMP identifies a valuation bias in cohesive syndicate networks.

**2. Regulation and Entrepreneurship** I investigate how policy changes—such as worker classification laws (AB5)—alter incentives for founders and investors, affecting firm entry and risk-taking.

**3. Private Markets and Investor Behavior** I explore how information frictions and valuation opacity in private markets influence investor decisions and capital flows.
