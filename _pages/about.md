# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at Stevens Institute of Technology. My research studies how **financing, regulation, and market structure shape entrepreneurial outcomes**, with a particular focus on **venture capital, firm dynamics, and the distribution of startup growth and failure**.

I am especially interested in settings where policy or institutional changes alter incentives for founders, investors, and workers, and in understanding how these changes affect **entry, exit, growth trajectories, and risk-taking** among young firms. Much of my work uses large-scale U.S. administrative data combined with quasi-experimental and structural methods.


I am currently working on my dissertation under the advisement of **Prof. Stefano Bonini**.
