I had the honor of serving as a **Session Chair** for the Equity Crowdfunding session and as a **Discussant** at the **6th Annual RCF-ECGI Corporate Finance and Governance Conference**, hosted here at Stevens Institute of Technology.

I discussed the paper *"Breaking Network Barriers in the Era of Data-Driven Venture Capitalists"* by Melissa Crumling (Drexel University). It was a productive weekend of high-quality feedback and networking with colleagues from ECGI and beyond.
