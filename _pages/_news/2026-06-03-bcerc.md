I am thrilled to announce that two of my working papers have been accepted for presentation at the **2026 Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference (BCERC)**, to be held at the University of Alabama.

BCERC is widely considered the premier conference for entrepreneurship research. I will be presenting:
1.  **"Should Founders Raise Funds from VCs?"**
2.  **"Worker (Mis)classification Laws and Entrepreneurship"**

I look forward to discussing these findings with the entrepreneurship community in Tuscaloosa this June!
