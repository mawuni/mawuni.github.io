My paper, **"When Investors Don’t Trust the NAV: Valuation Opacity and Runs"**, has been selected for presentation at the **18th Annual Alternative Investments Conference** hosted by UNC Chapel Hill.

This exclusive forum brings together fewer than 250 leading academics and industry professionals (LPs, GPs, and hedge fund managers) to discuss the latest trends in private equity and alternative assets. I am excited to share my work on valuation opacity and receive feedback from both academic and industry experts.
